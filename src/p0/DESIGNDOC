			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?
Nothing specific.

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
I didn't use any particular data structures.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
I use input_getc() function to read characters. Any character instead of enter will be stacked into the self-defined input buffer. When we see an enter char, we compare the input buffer with the specific commands, such as "whoami" and "exit". I also use the printf() function to output the messages onto the console.

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
No.
